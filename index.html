        <div class="answer">
            <p>As someone who's always been an introvert, I never imagined feeling so free and at ease with someone so quickly. I’ve always taken time, especially around people, and even more around girls. But the first time I met Afifa in study room… it felt different. It didn’t feel like a “first meeting”—it felt like a reunion, like I had known her in a hundred lifetimes before this one. She didn’t feel like a stranger. She felt like home. And that’s when I knew—this girl, with her calm presence and effortless warmth, she’s the one. I used to find comfort in staying alone in my room, but now, my favorite place in the world is wherever she is.</p>

            <p> Where do I even begin? Afifa is beautiful—undeniably so. She’s cute, she’s stunning, and there’s something about her eyes that I could get lost in forever. She’s like a perfect blend of charm and fire, softness and strength. But beyond her looks, what truly makes her unforgettable is her dedication. Her drive, her hard work, the way she gives her all to everything she does—it inspires me every single day. And let’s not forget—she’s a genius. Whether it’s solving a tough math problem or debugging. Beauty, brains, and a heart full of determination—that’s Afifa, and that’s why I admire her more than words can say..</p>

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>My dreams with you, Afifa, are not just dreams—they are promises wrapped in love. I want to hold your hand and travel every corner of this world together, from quiet mountain mornings to starry city nights. I want us to raise children who feel the warmth of our love in every hug, in every bedtime story, in every “I’m proud of you.” I dream of building a life so full of joy that even the walls of our home echo our laughter. And when we grow old, with silver in our hair and wrinkles carved by decades of smiles—I want us to still sit side by side, your hand in mine, hearts full of memories, and eyes that still look at each other like it's day one.</p>

        <div class="answer">
            <p>Afifa, I want you to remember that you are deeply loved—not just on the good days when everything is perfect, but even on the hard days when nothing feels right. I will stand by you, always. No distance, time, or storm can ever change what I feel for you. You are my peace, my reason, and my forever choice. So whenever you're unsure, close your eyes and remember: there's someone out there whose entire heart is yours—and it will always beat for you.</p>
