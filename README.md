# Responsive-FAQ-section

I recently built a responsive and interactive FAQ section as part of my frontend development learning journey. This project uses:
âœ… HTML for structure
âœ… CSS for styling and smooth animations
âœ… JavaScript to toggle answers and animate icons

ðŸ§© Features:

Click-to-expand answers

Icon rotation for better UX

Clean, mobile-responsive design

This project helped me better understand DOM manipulation, CSS transitions, and building user-friendly interfaces.
Check out the code and feel free to share your feedback!
